# Editing the Code

I use `DBD.js` as the coding language for the bot. However, you can also use a bit of `js` to make things easier.

## Commenting

I like to comment on my code to make everything neater and easier to read and access. But you can't do that inside strings!
```js
${/*  comment text here */''} 
```
