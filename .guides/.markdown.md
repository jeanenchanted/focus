## Create a table of contents

- Run command "`Create Table of Contents`" to insert a new table of contents.

- The TOC is automatically updated on file save by default. To disable, please change the toc.updateOnSave option.

- The indentation type (tab or spaces) of TOC can be configured per file. Find the setting in the right bottom corner of VS Code's status bar.

- Note: Be sure to also check the list.indentationSize option.

- To make TOC compatible with GitHub or GitLab, set option slugifyMode accordingly

- Three ways to control which headings are present in the TOC: <details> <summary> Click to expand </summary>

  1. Add `<!-- omit in toc -->` at the end of a heading to ignore it in TOC
(It can also be placed above a heading)

  1. Use toc.levels setting.

  2. You can also use the toc.omittedFromToc setting to omit some headings (and their subheadings) from TOC:

    ```json
    // In your settings.json
    "markdown.extension.toc.omittedFromToc": {
      // Use a path relative to your workspace.
     "README.md": [
         "# Introduction",
        "## Also omitted",
     ],
     // Or an absolute path for standalone files.
     "/home/foo/Documents/todo-list.md": [
       "## Shame list (I'll never do these)",
     ]
    }
    ```

    **Note:**

  - Setext headings (underlined with === or ---) can also be omitted, just put their # and ## versions in the setting, respectively.

  - When omitting heading, make sure headings within a document are unique. Duplicate headings may lead to unpredictable behavior.
</details>

- Easily add/update/remove section numbering

In case you are seeing unexpected TOC recognition, you can add a <!-- no toc --> comment above the list.
